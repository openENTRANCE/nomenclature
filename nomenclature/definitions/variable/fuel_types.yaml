  Gas:
    description: Natural gas (including methane from biomass or hydrogenation)
    ccs: True

Gas|OCGT:
     description: Natural gas (including methane from biomass or hydrogenation). A typical Open Cycle Gas Turbine power plant.
     ccs: True

 Gas|CCGT:

  Non-Biomass Renewables:
    description: Hydro, wind, solar, geothermal, ocean, and other renewable
                 sources excluding bioenergy

  Hydro:
    description: Hydropower
Hydro|Run of River:
description: Hydropower produced by run-of-river power plants (ie. without  storage capacity). 

Hydro|Pumped Storage:
description: Hydropower systems with short-term storage capacity and including pumping turbines. This hydropower plant has two water reservoirs at different elevations: one at the upper level and one at the lower level. It can generate power (discharge) as water moves down through a turbine; however, it draws power as it pumps water (recharge) to the reservoir at the upper level.

Hydro|Reservoir:
description: Hydropower systems with seasonal storage capacity (it can also include) pumping turbines. This hydropower plant has two water reservoirs at different elevations: one at the upper level and one at the lower level. It can generate power (discharge) as water moves down through a turbine; however, it draws power as it pumps water (recharge) to the reservoir at the upper level.
