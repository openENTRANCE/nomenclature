# Variables needed for plan4EU results in terms of electricity system operation
# Schedules per power generation technologies, storages and demand-response
# includes for each technology:
#   - Active Power
#   - Operation Cost
#   - Reserves committed and Inertia provided
#   - Levels of storages
# Marginal costs for:
#   - Demand in ACtive Power
#   - Demand in reserves
#   - Demand in inertia
#   - Flows in transmission lines
# Demand not served

# Active Power per technologies
# i.e.  aggregated committed (in general hourly) schedules of plants
