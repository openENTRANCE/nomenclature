## Aim and scope of this repository

The [Horizon 2020 openENTRANCE project](https://openentrance.eu) aims at
developing, using and disseminating an open, transparent and integrated
modelling platform for assessing low-carbon transition pathways in Europe.
A key requirement for an effective linking of models and consistent analysis is
a common "nomenclature", i.e., shared lists of variables, regions and units
used across the entire project.

This repository makes available the nomenclature used within the consortium and
serves as a discussion platform for extending the lists of terms.

*We invite other modelling teams to contribute and join the discussion,
hoping to facilitate increased cooperation across research projects
on (European) energy and climate policy!*
